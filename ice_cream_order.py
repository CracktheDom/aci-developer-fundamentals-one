"""For this task, imagine that you are the proud owner of an ice cream shop. As
an entrepreneur, you know that increased efficiency can be the thing that sets
you apart from other stores. With all that you now know about iterables, data
types, conditionals, and user input, you're ready to build the logic for an
application that can automatically take customer orders.

To create a complete order, your order-taker needs to know how the ice cream
should be served, the number of scoops requested, and the flavor of ice cream
for each scoop. The following table includes the suggested options.

options                                   Available choices
Serving choice                               cone or cup
Number of scoops                             1, 2, or 3
Flavor               vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, cherry, mint, peach, or grape

Write a program that greets customers and takes their ice cream order. Allow
customers to order multiple cones or cups, with a different flavor possible for
each scoop. If a customer enters an invalid option, notify them of the error
and prompt them again."""
