Task: Password checker

Many websites prompt users to create a password to protect their account. The
companies hosting websites often have different requirements to ensure that
user passwords include a significant degree of complexity. When you enter a new
password, it can be checked for complexity and assigned a strength score.

For this task, you will write a module that includes functions that check a
string for complexity, and return a password strength score to the user. Then,
you will write a script that imports the module. When it runs, it should ask the user for a password and print the strength score, along with some context to explain if the password is strong enough.

Use the following steps to help you build the program:

    1. Create the module file. Define functions to check if the user included special characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers. Each check should add a point to the overall strength score if the check is successful.

    2. Return a strength score for each password that it checks.

    3. Write a script that imports the appropriate function(s), and asks the user to input a password. When the program runs, it should print out the strength of the provided password and a message about whether it is strong enough, or if the user should try again.
